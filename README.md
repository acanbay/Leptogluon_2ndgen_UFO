# Color-Octet Muon (μ₈) UFO Model

This UFO model provides a complete implementation of the theoretical framework describing the **color-octet muon (μ₈)** — a hypothetical particle arising in **composite lepton models**, which go beyond the Standard Model (SM). These models suggest that leptons may not be elementary particles, but instead have substructure composed of more fundamental entities called **preons**.

The model is developed within the **FeynRules** framework and exported in the **UFO (Universal FeynRules Output)** format. It is designed for use with **MadGraph5_aMC@NLO**, enabling event generation and phenomenological studies involving μ₈ production and decay.
