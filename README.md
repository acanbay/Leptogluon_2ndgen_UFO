# Color-Octet Muon (μ₈) UFO Model
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/466849344.svg)](https://zenodo.org/records/15676777)

This UFO model provides a complete implementation of the theoretical framework describing the color-octet muon (μ₈) — a hypothetical particle predicted by composite lepton theories, which extend beyond the Standard Model (SM). These theories propose that leptons are not fundamental particles but have an internal composite structure.

The model is developed using the FeynRules package and exported in the UFO (Universal FeynRules Output) format. It is designed for use with MadGraph5, enabling event generation and phenomenological studies of μ₈ production and decay.
